                   <h3> Photoshop CC </h3>
                   <p>                 
                    Photoshop is a powerful
                    and popular image editing
                    software that helps you 
                    to apply various effects 
                    easily and get consistent
                    results. Many people use 
                    this software to create 
                    a better quality image, 
                    because it has many features 
                    that are hardly available
                    in other photo editing software.
                    Most of the regular edits like 
                    teeth whitening, skin tone 
                    adjusting, and red eye 
                    removal can be completed 
                    with a single click.

                <h3> Notepad++ </h3>
                
            <p> Open Source: I suppose 
                nothing beats having a
                notepad replacement
                that is completely free.
                In addition, its open 
                nature means that changes
                can be made in order to
                facilitate one's development 
                efforts. Search and Replace: 
                I've personally found it to be
                very useful when editing
                configuration files, which
                required a search and replace 
                of multiple items.
